    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a crossover fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd. for the Nintendo Switch console. It was released in December 2018 and is the fifth installment in the Super Smash Bros. series.

The game features a roster of over 80 playable characters, including popular Nintendo icons like Mario, Link, and Pikachu, as well as third-party characters such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, and Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII. Each character has their unique moveset and playstyle, making them feel distinct from one another.

The objective of the game is to knock opponents off the stage, with each character having a percentage meter that increases as they take damage. The higher the percentage, the easier it is to launch them off the stage. The game offers various game modes, including classic mode, adventure mode, and multiplayer modes such as online play, local play, and tournament mode.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has received critical acclaim for its extensive content, including a vast roster of characters, stages, and music tracks from various games. The game's attention to detail and polished mechanics make it a must-play for both casual and competitive gamers.
